# Dockerised Quasar development

> Create your mobile, web and/or desktop app from a single HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (VueJS/Quasar) source

> This repository provides a Quasar development environment using docker to get you up and running fast.
The docker image has Quasar cli, Cordova, Android SDK and their dependencies pre-installed and configured
so you can jump straight to the happy coding part.

#### What is Quasar?

Single Page Apps, Server-side Render apps and Progressive Web apps all from a single VueJS ( :heartbeat: ) codebase.

#### What is Cordova?
[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a library for building cross-platform mobile applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Package contents

This repository consists of

- a docker-compose file which uses an 'android-cordova-quasar' docker image
- an empty quasar-cli project (the starter codebase generated by 'quasar init')
- some package.json "scripts" to get started

Please note that building your project for Mac and Windows mobile - as well as desktop - platforms will require some extra steps relevant to each platform.

For Android, you are ready to go.

## Prerequisites

On your local machine you will first need to have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- yarn ( `npm install -g yarn` , or [platform specific way](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) )

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/djleven/quasar-dockerised-starter.git
    cd quasar-dockerised-starter
    yarn

## Kickstart

1-) Start the container and launch hot reload dev environment (@ localhost:8080)

    docker-compose up -d

2-) Add platform(s) you will be developing for:

Edit the packages.json with your app info (title, desc, author, etc)

Then run what you need

    npm run add-android
    npm run add-ios
    npm run add-electron
    npm run add-pwa

The above commands run `quasar`, `cordova`, etc commands inside the container.

Note: After adding electron you will probably have to restart your container.


## Build / preview for Android

    npm run add-android

If you wish to preview / install the build on your android device,
connect it to your computer with a usb before running this
(assuming Android developer settings are correct)

Note: The first time you run this command the build android process will take longer than the subsequent builds.

## Run other commands in container

To launch a command prompt inside the container

    npm run dc-bash

which is short for:

    docker-compose exec quasar /bin/bash

To run one or more commands inside the container directly

    npm run dc-exec 'runSomeCommand && maybeAnotherCommand'

which is short for

    docker-compose exec quasar bash -c 'runSomeCommand && maybeAnotherCommand'

To run either one of the above but with your local system user id, just add a 'u' at the end

    npm run dc-bashu
    npm run dc-execu
